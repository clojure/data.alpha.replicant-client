# replicant-client

A Clojure a library providing client-side implementations of Clojure datastructures served by [replicant-server](https://github.com/clojure/data.alpha.replicant-server).

## Rationale

While the ability to connect to Clojure REPLs over a wire is a powerful lever for programmers, the transport of data-structures can bog down an active connection. Replicant works to avoid sending data over the wire until it's requested. "Large" data structures (via length or depth) are "remotified" - stored in a cache on the server, passed as a remote reference. When more data is needed, replicant-client interacts with replicant-server to retrieve more data.
